Story
On May 22, 2010 a person by the name of Laszlo Hanyecz used 10,000 Bitcoins to buy 2 large pizzas which was worth $41 USD. In today's terms, Laszlo would have spent over 500 million on 2 large pizzas (check the link for the updated numbers https://bitcoinpizzaindex.net/)! 

How Rare Pizzas got started and my involvement
During the beginning of 2021, I was still at home doing remote learning due to the COVID-19 pandemic. What this meant for me was that I had a little additional time to explore my interests in cryptocurrencies. At the sametime, two topics/technologies were booming: clubhouse and NFT’s. I was not very familiar and did not understand the concepts of NFT’s, so I was on YouTube trying to learn more about them and I ran into a video talking about Rare Pizzas: a group of individuals who met in the “Room about nothing” on Clubhouse had the idea of feeding the world free pizza by selling pizza NFT. They wanted to create such a project to commemorate the transaction Laszlo made in 2010 and show that NFT's blockchain technology, cryptocurrencies would be the future. I thought this was a super interesting and challenging project, using NTfs to raise money and then feeding the entire world free pizza, so I joined the group.

The idea was this: we would have 10,000 “rare pizzas” NFTs where the art would be made by those who shared the same vision of celebrating Bitcoin Pizza Day. We would then sell them and collect ETH (Etherium) as payment. 

I helped plan Bitcoin Pizza day by organizing the event in Canada, specifically in British Columbia, and the entirety of China. I had contacted many different pizza shops, translated marketing material, and coordinated with a member in China to help make this event international. 

In the end, the world’s first ever Bitcoin Pizza Day was a success. We had over 210 different pizzerias in over 40 countries participate in the event with around 138 shops in North America. All in all, this was a very fruitful project and I had learned lots about blockchain, NFTs, and of course meeting many talented people across the globe.
